# Sample One

This process is what I do and likely will not match what you do. It can however, be used as a template for a process.

## Objective

Reencode Dexter Season One from DVD to .mp4 for Plex servers

## Steps

- [X] use MakeMKV to decrypt the source files on the Dexter DVDs to a location on the source video disc
- [ ] use any file utilities to check the contents of the source it is to determine the type of video, the audio streams, and any subtitle files in formats
- [ ] determine which file is which i.e. season one episode one, rename and move move the source files to the to do or working folder (note a complicated name is not needed so it could be DEX0101.mkv
- [ ] continue until all files have been copied from source to target, remove any extra files you have no need for or simply not needed
- [ ] enter the data on the Excel spreadsheet
- [ ] copy the data from the Excel spreadsheet to the [ffmpeg.todo](ffmpeg.todo.md) file in the to do directory on the source server
- [ ] start of the slave machines and begin running the process
- [ ] start the process on the source machine as well
- [ ] when complete simply move the files from the slave machines to the target on the target machine ( which in my case is the same as the source )
